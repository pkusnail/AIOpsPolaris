  "severity": "HIGH",
  "affected_services": ["service-a", "service-b", "service-c"],
  "affected_call_paths": ["A->B->D*", "A->C->F"],
  "symptoms": {
    "user_facing": "System overloaded - 80% of requests experiencing high latency",
    "monitoring_alerts": [
      "Service B CPU and memory utilization > 90%",
      "Service C idle with < 5% resource utilization", 
      "Service A routing anomaly detected"
    ]
  },
  "root_cause": {
    "primary": "Service A load balancer configuration bug routing 95% traffic to B path, 5% to C path",
    "secondary": "Incorrect weight configuration after recent A service deployment"
  },
  "analysis_steps": [
    "1. System-wide performance degradation affecting most users",
    "2. Service B showing extreme load (95% CPU), Service C nearly idle",
    "3. Traffic distribution analysis shows 95:5 ratio instead of expected 60:40",
    "4. Load balancer logs reveal configuration change during last A deployment", 
    "5. Review A's routing configuration files",
    "6. Found hardcoded weight values overriding dynamic balancing",
    "7. Configuration error introduced in deployment automation"
  ],
  "resolution": "Corrected load balancer weights, redeployed A service, verified traffic distribution",
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Load balancer configurations must be validated before deployment",
    "Implement traffic distribution monitoring and alerting",
    "Automated rollback for routing configuration errors"
