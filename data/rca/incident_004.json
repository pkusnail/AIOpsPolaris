  "symptoms": {
    "user_facing": "50% of C path requests timing out, intermittent pattern",
    "monitoring_alerts": [
      "Service C socket timeout exceptions", 
      "Service F connection refused errors",

    "primary": "Network switch firmware bug causing packet drops between C and F network segments",
    "secondary": "Inadequate connection retry logic in C's F client configuration"
  },
  "analysis_steps": [
    "1. Intermittent 50% failure rate on A->C->F path",
    "2. Service C shows SocketTimeoutException to F",
    "3. Service F logs show some requests never arriving",
    "4. Network monitoring reveals 15% packet loss C<->F",
    "5. Other services communicating fine, isolated to C-F link",
    "6. Network team identifies faulty switch firmware",
    "7. Switch replaced, confirmed network stability restored"

  "resolution": "Replaced network switch, updated C service retry configuration",
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Network monitoring should track inter-service packet loss",
    "Implement exponential backoff retry logic",
