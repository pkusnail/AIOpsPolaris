  "resolved_at": "2025-08-21T11:30:00Z", 
  "duration_minutes": 135,
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "affected_services": ["service-d1"],
  "affected_call_paths": ["A->B->D1"],
  "symptoms": {
    "user_facing": "33% of requests through B path experiencing 5-10 second delays",
    "monitoring_alerts": [
      "Service D1 disk I/O wait time > 80%", 
      "Service D1 response time > 5s threshold",
      "Uneven load distribution across D instances"
    ]
  },
  "root_cause": {
    "primary": "Service D1 disk I/O bottleneck caused by large log files not being rotated",
    "secondary": "Log4j configuration missing rotation policy, causing single 15GB log file"
  },
  "analysis_steps": [
    "1. Monitoring shows 33% of B->D requests are slow",
    "2. Check load balancer - traffic evenly distributed to D1, D2, D3", 
    "3. D2 and D3 respond normally, D1 shows high response times",
    "4. D1 system metrics show 85% disk I/O wait time",
    "5. Investigation shows massive application.log (15GB)",
    "6. Log rotation configuration was overridden in last deployment",
    "7. Single large file causing read/write contention"
  ],
  "resolution": "Implemented emergency log rotation, fixed Log4j configuration, redistributed load during maintenance",
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Log rotation policies must be validated in deployment pipeline",
    "Disk I/O monitoring alerts needed for all service instances", 
    "Implement automatic log cleanup procedures"
